                            Social proof is a powerful psychological principle in consumer behavior.

                        By applying UX psychology principles across Caf√© Hanoi‚Äôs website, I craft an engaging, user-centric experience. Every design choice‚Äîfrom the Hero content to social proof‚Äîaligns with users' mental models and emotional needs, driving action, fostering loyalty, and encouraging return visits.

                        I also suggest offering both English and French versions of the website and menu to better target tourists, as most local competitors do not provide this bilingual option. This approach enhances accessibility and inclusivity, expanding Caf√© Hanoi‚Äôs reach to a broader audience and setting it apart from the competition. The result is an authentic, modern website that stays true to Caf√© Hanoi‚Äôs brand.
